vReporter is a modular version of Alan Renouf's vCheck v5 script 
(http://goo.gl/WYpr) incorporating Brian Wuchner's (enterpriseadmins.org)
modifications beginning with version 5.47 (http://goo.gl/iOxo9)

The goal of vReporter is to us the excellent vCheck script as a foundation
and create a modular VMware daily report which will allow easy additions of
different reports.

The hope is the easier it is to add to the report, the more the community
will get involved creating report modules, providing improvements to
the core, improvements to look of the reports, or whatever!
